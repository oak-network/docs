# Security Concepts

This guide covers the security concepts and principles underlying Oak Network.

## Security Model

### Zero Key Storage Policy
Oak Network never stores private keys or sensitive user data. This fundamental principle ensures that even if our systems are compromised, user funds remain secure.

### Decentralized Security
- Smart contracts are immutable once deployed
- No single point of failure
- Community-driven security monitoring
- Transparent and auditable code

## Key Management

### Privy Integration
- Social login and recovery
- Embedded wallet generation
- Multi-factor authentication
- Secure key derivation

### Turnkey Integration
- Hardware security modules
- Enterprise-grade key management
- Audit logging and compliance
- Advanced threat protection

## Smart Contract Security

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions
- Multi-signature requirements
- Time-locked functions
- Emergency pause mechanisms

### Input Validation
- Comprehensive input checking
- Integer overflow protection
- Address validation
- Amount verification

### Error Handling
- Custom error messages
- Gas-efficient reverts
- Proper state management
- Graceful failure handling

## Platform Security

### Integration Security
- Secure API endpoints
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Input sanitization
- Authentication and authorization

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data storage
- Encrypted communications
- Privacy-preserving design
- GDPR compliance

## Monitoring and Auditing

### Real-time Monitoring
- Transaction analysis
- Anomaly detection
- Automated alerts
