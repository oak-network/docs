# Platform Integration

This guide covers how to integrate Oak Network's crowdfunding capabilities into your existing platform.

## Overview

Oak Network is designed as infrastructure that can be integrated into any platform, whether it's a crowdfunding platform, e-commerce site, or any other application that needs fundraising capabilities.

## Integration Methods

### Direct Smart Contract Integration

The most flexible approach is to interact directly with Oak Network's smart contracts using `ethers.js` or similar libraries.

### API Integration (Coming Soon)

Oak Network will provide REST APIs for easier integration without requiring direct blockchain interaction.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your development environment**
2. **Connect to Celo network**
