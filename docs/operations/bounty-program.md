## Our Open-Source Stack

We've designed our stack to be powerful for Web3 natives and accessible for all developers.

### Oak Protocol
The core smart contracts governing crowdfunding campaigns, treasuries, and payouts. Fully audited and production-ready.

### Catalyst
A centralized API service that provides a simple, fast, and reliable way to interact with all our services and smart contracts. No deep knowledge of blockchain is required to get started.

### SDKs
Software Development Kits built on top of Catalyst to make integration into your applications seamless. **SDK development will commence after Catalyst v1.0 is stable**, as Catalyst serves as the foundation for all SDK implementations.

**Supported Languages** (under development):
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Primary SDK with full feature support
- **Python**: For data science, analytics, and backend integrations
- **Go**: For high-performance server-side applications and infrastructure tools

**Note**: SDKs are currently in active development. Early access may be available for bounty participants working on Catalyst-related projects.

### Signet
Our open-source solution for key management and transaction signing. Signet uses embedded wallets and MPC (powered by Turnkey) so your users can interact with your dApp without ever seeing a seed phrase, while you never have to hold their keys.

## Bounty Categories

We have structured bounties across four key categories. Whether you want to contribute to our core, expand the protocol's capabilities, bridge Web2 and Web3, or build a full-fledged product, there's a challenge for you.

**Note**: These categories represent potential areas of work. Specific bounties and features will be distributed through GitHub issues after developers are invited to the program.

---

## 1. Core Development

**Status**: Building v1.0 | **Model**: Assisted Open Source  
**Total Bounty Pool**: $18,000 USD (30%)

**Note**: Individual bounty amounts will be agreed upon in meetings or based on delivery quality. The amounts listed are flexible and will be determined during project discussions.

This category is not about building on our tools—it's about building the tools themselves. Catalyst (our API layer) and Signet (our key management layer) are currently in active pre-v1.0 development.

We are looking for experienced backend, security, and systems engineers to act as an extension of our core team. You won't just be submitting random PRs; you will join our architecture meetings, co-create issues with our leads, and have your contributions funded transparently upon PR approval.

### How We Build Trust

We use the **Opire platform** to manage all bounties. This ensures that:

- Scoped issues have verified funding attached
- Payouts are automated and transparent upon PR approval
- Code review processes are clear and fair
- All contributions are properly credited
- Real-time tracking of bounty progress and payouts

### Open Initiatives (Core)

We are currently focused on three major workstreams to reach Catalyst & Signet v1.0.

#### Initiative A (TOP PRIORITY): Signet (Key Management Layer)

**Focus**: Signet is a fundamental part of our architecture. It is responsible for creating wallets for partners and signing all transactions without interference from our protocol. We want to build a transparent, effective way to create wallets for platforms and to sign transactions without holding any sensitive information.

**Core Tasks**: 
- Tasks will be created after meeting with developers
- Areas include: MPC wallet creation, transaction signing flows, security audits, documentation
- Integration with Turnkey and other key management providers

**Bounty Target**: TBD (discussed during onboarding meetings)

**Requirements**:
- Strong background in security and cryptography
- Experience with MPC (Multi-Party Computation)
- Understanding of wallet management systems
- Ability to work closely with our core team

#### Initiative B: Catalyst API

**Focus**: The Catalyst is our aggregator, our centralized API that enables companies to integrate with Smart contracts and internal services without the hassle of smart contract integration or multiple service calls.

**Core Task**: Implement a group of Smart contract integration calls via Catalyst—examples include:
- Campaign management (create, read, update)
- Pledge management (create pledges, track status)
- Analytics (campaign metrics, user statistics)
- Treasury operations (fund releases, milestone tracking)

**Bounty Target**: Postman collection with all calls working, comprehensive documentation, and test coverage.

**Deliverables**:
- Complete API endpoints for core operations
- Postman/OpenAPI collection
- Comprehensive documentation with examples
- Unit and integration tests
- Error handling and validation

**Requirements**:
- Strong backend development skills
- Experience with RESTful API design
- Understanding of blockchain integration
- Good documentation practices

#### Initiative C: SDK Development

**Status**: Development will commence after Catalyst v1.0 is stable and complete.

**Focus**: Official SDKs for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, and Go to make Oak Network integration seamless across different development environments.

**Development Stack**:
- **Backend SDKs**: Go or JavaScript/TypeScript (choose what's best for your use case)
- **Frontend**: React (always required for UI components)
- **Integration**: All SDKs built on top of Catalyst API

**Note**: Contributors who excel in the Catalyst phase will have priority for leading these SDK projects. SDKs are currently under active development.

## 2. Smart Contract Extensions (Protocol Level)

**Total Bounty Pool**: $6,000 USD (10%)

**Note**: Individual bounty amounts will be agreed upon in meetings or based on delivery quality. The amounts listed are flexible and will be determined during project discussions.

Expand the fundamental capabilities of the Oak protocol. These bounties are for developers who want to design and build new on-chain funding mechanisms.

### Bounty: Quadratic Funding (QF) Treasury

**Challenge**: Design and implement a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) smart contract for a quadratic funding treasury model that integrates with the core Oak protocol.

**Requirements**:
- Integration with existing Oak protocol contracts
- Quadratic funding calculation logic
- Donor matching mechanism
- Security audit considerations
- Comprehensive documentation

### Bounty: Retroactive Public Goods Funding (Retro-PGF) Module

**Challenge**: Design a contract module that allows the community to fund projects that have already delivered value. The contract must manage a results pool and a voting/distribution mechanism.

**Requirements**:
- Retroactive funding logic
- Voting mechanism for value assessment
- Distribution algorithms
- Integration with Oak protocol
- Documentation and examples

### Bounty: Yield-Generating Treasury (DeFi-Native)

**Challenge**: A treasury that, upon receiving donations (e.g., USDC), automatically deposits them into a blue-chip, audited lending protocol (e.g., Aave, Compound). The yield earned can be configured to (1) add to the creator's total, (2) be redistributed to donors, or (3) be claimed by the Oak protocol.

**Requirements**:
- Integration with DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound, etc.)
- Configurable yield distribution
- Security considerations for DeFi interactions
- Gas optimization
- Documentation

### Bounty: Multi-Currency Treasury

**Challenge**: Design a treasury that can accept donations in multiple tokens (e.g., USDC, WETH, ARB) and use a price oracle (e.g., Chainlink) to track the total value raised against a single USD-denominated goal.

**Requirements**:
- Multi-token support
- Price oracle integration (Chainlink)
- Value aggregation logic
- Handling of token decimals
- Security best practices

### Bounty: Conviction Voting Module

**Challenge**: Implement a continuous funding module based on conviction voting. Donors stake tokens to a proposal, and "conviction" (voting power) builds over time. When conviction reaches a threshold, funds are released. This is ideal for ongoing, long-term grants.

**Requirements**:
- Conviction voting algorithm
- Time-weighted voting power
- Threshold-based release mechanism
- Integration with Oak protocol
- Documentation

### Bounty: Donor-Voted Payouts

**Challenge**: An alternative to the multisig milestone. Create a module where the donors themselves (token-weighted or 1-person-1-vote via an identity system) vote to approve or reject the release of the next milestone's funds.

**Requirements**:
- Voting mechanism (token-weighted or identity-based)
- Milestone approval logic
- Integration with identity systems (if applicable)
- Gas-efficient voting
- Documentation

### Bounty: Failsafe / Dead Man's Switch

**Challenge**: A milestone module with a failsafe. If the project creator fails to provide an update or check in by a deadline, the verifiers (or donors) can trigger a "clawback" function to return the remaining, unspent funds to the donors.

**Requirements**:
- Deadline tracking mechanism
- Clawback function implementation
- Verifier or donor-triggered mechanism
- Security considerations
- Documentation

### Bounty: Milestone-Based Payouts

**Challenge**: Create a treasury extension module where funds are unlocked based on verifiable milestones, not all at once.

**Deliverable**: 
- The smart contract logic
- A minimal UI for "milestone verifiers" (e.g., a multisig) to approve payouts
- Integration with Oak protocol
- Documentation

### Bounty: Streaming Treasury (Superfluid Integration)

**Challenge**: Integrate a streaming payment protocol (e.g., Superfluid) with our treasury contracts.

**Deliverable**: A PoC allowing a campaign to receive its funds as a constant, real-time stream.

**Requirements**:
- Superfluid integration
- Streaming payment logic
- Real-time fund distribution
- Documentation and examples

**Bounty Amount**: To be agreed upon in meetings or based on delivery quality
