# 🚀 Oak Network Protocol Launches on Celo

We're excited to announce the official launch of the Oak Network protocol on the Celo blockchain! After months of development, testing, and security audits, we're ready to revolutionize decentralized crowdfunding infrastructure.

## What is Oak Network?

Oak Network is a decentralized crowdfunding infrastructure built on the Celo blockchain that serves as the foundation for all applications, crowdfunding-specific or not, to leverage the power of blockchain technology for fundraising with a transparent 1% fee that goes directly to the ecosystem.

## Key Features Now Live

### 🏗️ **Infrastructure-First Approach**
Oak Network is designed as infrastructure, not just another platform. Any application can integrate our smart contracts to add crowdfunding capabilities without building from scratch.

### 💰 **Transparent Fee Structure**
- **1% Protocol Fee**: Goes directly to the Oak Network ecosystem
- **Platform Fees**: Configurable per platform integration
- **No Hidden Costs**: All fees are transparent and on-chain

### 🔒 **Security & Trust**
- **Audited Smart Contracts**: Comprehensive security audits by leading firms
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent and community-driven development
- **Zero Key Storage**: We never store private keys, using Privy and Turnkey for security

### 🌍 **Celo Blockchain Benefits**
- **Low Fees**: Cost-effective transactions for all users
- **Fast Settlement**: Quick campaign creation and fund distribution
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for mobile DeFi experiences
- **Carbon Negative**: Environmentally conscious blockchain choice

## Smart Contracts Deployed

Our core smart contracts are now live on Celo:

- **CampaignInfoFactory**: Creates and manages campaign instances
- **CampaignInfo**: Stores campaign metadata and configuration
- **GlobalParams**: Manages protocol-wide parameters and fees
